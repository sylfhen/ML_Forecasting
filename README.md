# ML_Forecasting
The objective was to use the diverse methodologies available for Sales Forecasting. XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. They have been relied upon for this task. However, Neural Networks (NNs) offer unique advantages, particularly in handling vast datasets and capturing intricate interdependencies among variables, including non-linear relationships. Hence, this research aims to compare the performance of baseline models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression) against a Neural Network model for sales forecasting, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their predictive capabilities<img width="3575" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d51222bf-1d09-482c-bca5-53824c7a92a8" />

In conclusion:
The XGBoost marginally yields the best performance.
This is decided on the R square and the MSE.
The baseline model is effective for sales forecasting.
